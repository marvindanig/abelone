<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Little as Geppetto&apos;s house was, it was neat and comfortable. It was a small room on the ground floor, with a tiny window under the stairway. The furniture could not have been much simpler: a very old chair, a rickety old bed, and a tumble-down table. A fireplace full of burning logs was painted on the wall opposite the door. Over the fire, there was painted a pot full of something which kept boiling happily away and sending up clouds of what looked like real steam.</p><p>As soon as he reached home, Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette.</p></div> </div>
