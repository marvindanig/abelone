I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In that case,&quot; said Pinocchio proudly, as he stood up and flung away his cap of dough, &quot;in that case, my duty is clear. Come, officers! Tie me up and throw me on those flames. No, it is not fair for poor Harlequin, the best friend that I have in the world, to die in my place!&quot;</p><p>These brave words, said in a piercing voice, made all the other Marionettes cry. Even the officers, who were made of wood also, cried like two babies.</p></div> </div>
