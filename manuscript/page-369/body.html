And to think that the teacher, when speaking of you, used to say, &apos;Do not go with that Lamp-Wick! He is a bad companion and some day he will lead you astray.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Poor teacher!&quot; answered the other, nodding his head. &quot;Indeed I know how much he disliked me and how he enjoyed speaking ill of me. But I am of a generous nature, and I gladly forgive him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great soul!&quot; said Pinocchio, fondly embracing his friend.</p></div> </div>
