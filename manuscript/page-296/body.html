<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Help, Pinocchio, dear little Pinocchio! Save me from death!&quot;</p><p>At those cries of suffering, the Marionette, who after all had a very kind heart, was moved to compassion. He turned toward the poor animal and said to him:</p><p>&quot;But if I help you, will you promise not to bother me again by running after me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I promise! I promise! Only hurry, for if you wait another second, I&apos;ll be dead and gone!&quot;</p></div> </div>
