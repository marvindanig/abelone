<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;How unhappy I have been,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;And yet I deserve everything, for I am certainly very stubborn and stupid! I will always have my own way. I won&apos;t listen to those who love me and who have more brains than I. But from now on, I&apos;ll be different and I&apos;ll try to become a most obedient boy. I have found out, beyond any doubt whatever, that disobedient boys are certainly far from happy, and that, in the long run, they always lose out. I wonder if Father is waiting for me. Will I find him at the Fairy&apos;s house? It is so long, poor man, since I have seen him, and I do so want his love and his kisses. And will the Fairy ever forgive me for all I have done? She who has been so good to me and to whom I owe my life! Can there be a worse or more heartless boy than I am anywhere?&quot;</p></div> </div>
