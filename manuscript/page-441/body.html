<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes, yes, yes! It is I! Look at me! And you have forgiven me, haven&apos;t you? Oh, my dear Father, how good you are! And to think that I&#x2014;Oh, but if you only knew how many misfortunes have fallen on my head and how many troubles I have had! Just think that on the day you sold your old coat to buy me my A-B-C book so that I could go to school, I ran away to the Marionette Theater and the proprietor caught me and wanted to burn me to cook his roast lamb! He was the one who gave me the five gold pieces for you, but I met the Fox and the Cat, who took me to the Inn of the Red Lobster. There they ate like wolves and I left the Inn alone and I met the Assassins in the wood. I ran and they ran after me, always after me, till they hanged me to the branch of a giant oak tree. Then the Fairy of the Azure Hair sent the coach to rescue me and the doctors, after looking at me, said, &apos;If he is not dead, then he is surely alive,&apos; and then I told a lie and my nose began to grow. It grew and it grew, till I couldn&apos;t get it through the door of the room. And then I went with the Fox and the Cat to the Field of Wonders to bury the gold pieces. The Parrot laughed at me and, instead of two thousand gold pieces, I found none. When the Judge heard I had been robbed, he sent me to jail to make the thieves happy; and when I came away I saw a fine bunch of grapes hanging on a vine. The trap caught me and the Farmer put a collar on me and made me a watchdog. He found out I was innocent when I caught the Weasels and he let me go. The Serpent with the tail that smoked started to laugh and a vein in his chest broke and so I went back to the Fairy&apos;s house. She was dead, and the Pigeon, seeing me crying, said to me, &apos;I have seen your father building a boat to look for you in America,&apos; and I said to him, &apos;Oh, if I only had wings!&apos; and he said to me, &apos;Do you want to go to your father?&apos; and I said, &apos;Perhaps, but how?&apos; and he said, &apos;Get on my back. I&apos;ll take you there.&apos; We flew all night long, and next morning the fishermen were looking toward the sea, crying, &apos;There is a poor little man drowning,&apos; and I knew it was you, because my heart told me so and I waved to you from the shore&#x2014;&quot;</p></div> </div>
