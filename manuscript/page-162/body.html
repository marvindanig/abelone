<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;It happened that Fire Eater gave me five gold pieces to give to my Father, but on the way, I met a Fox and a Cat, who asked me, &apos;Do you want the five pieces to become two thousand?&apos; And I said, &apos;Yes.&apos; And they said, &apos;Come with us to the Field of Wonders.&apos; And I said, &apos;Let&apos;s go.&apos; Then they said, &apos;Let us stop at the Inn of the Red Lobster for dinner and after midnight we&apos;ll set out again.&apos; We ate and went to sleep. When I awoke they were gone and I started out in the darkness all alone. On the road I met two Assassins dressed in black coal sacks, who said to me, &apos;Your money or your life!&apos; and I said, &apos;I haven&apos;t any money&apos;; for, you see, I had put the money under my tongue. One of them tried to put his hand in my mouth and I bit it off and spat it out; but it wasn&apos;t a hand, it was a cat&apos;s paw. And they ran after me and I ran and ran, till at last they caught me and tied my neck with a rope and hanged me to a tree, saying, &apos;Tomorrow we&apos;ll come back for you and you&apos;ll be dead and your mouth will be open, and then we&apos;ll take the gold pieces that you have hidden under your tongue.&apos;&quot;</p></div> </div>
