<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;A classmate of mine. I wanted to return home. I wanted to be obedient. I wanted to study and to succeed in school, but Lamp-Wick said to me, &apos;Why do you want to waste your time studying? Why do you want to go to school? Come with me to the Land of Toys. There we&apos;ll never study again. There we can enjoy ourselves and be happy from morn till night.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why did you follow the advice of that false friend?&quot;</p></div> </div>
