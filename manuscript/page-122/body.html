<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Dear, oh, dear! When I come to think of it,&quot; said the Marionette to himself, as he once more set out on his journey, &quot;we boys are really very unlucky. Everybody scolds us, everybody gives us advice, everybody warns us. If we were to allow it, everyone would try to be father and mother to us; everyone, even the Talking Cricket. Take me, for example. Just because I would not listen to that bothersome Cricket, who knows how many misfortunes may be awaiting me! Assassins indeed! At least I have never believed in them, nor ever will. To speak sensibly, I think assassins have been invented by fathers and mothers to frighten children who want to run away at night. And then, even if I were to meet them on the road, what matter? I&apos;ll just run up to them, and say, &apos;Well, signori, what do you want? Remember that you can&apos;t fool with me! Run along and mind your business.&apos; At such a speech, I can almost see those poor fellows running like the wind. But in case they don&apos;t run away, I can always run myself. . .&quot;</p></div> </div>
