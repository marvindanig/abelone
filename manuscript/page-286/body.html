<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Eugene! My poor Eugene! Open your eyes and look at me! Why don&apos;t you answer? I was not the one who hit you, you know. Believe me, I didn&apos;t do it. Open your eyes, Eugene? If you keep them shut, I&apos;ll die, too. Oh, dear me, how shall I ever go home now? How shall I ever look at my little mother again? What will happen to me? Where shall I go? Where shall I hide? Oh, how much better it would have been, a thousand times better, if only I had gone to school! Why did I listen to those boys? They always were a bad influence! And to think that the teacher had told me&#x2014;and my mother, too!&#x2014;&apos;Beware of bad company!&apos; That&apos;s what she said. But I&apos;m stubborn and proud. I listen, but always I do as I wish. And then I pay. I&apos;ve never had a moment&apos;s peace since I&apos;ve been born! Oh, dear! What will become of me? What will become of me?&quot;</p></div> </div>
