What have I done?&quot; cried Pinocchio, grasping his two long ears in his hands and pulling and tugging at them angrily, just as if they belonged to another.</p><p>&quot;My dear boy,&quot; answered the Dormouse to cheer him up a bit, &quot;why worry now? What is done cannot be undone, you know. Fate has decreed that all lazy boys who come to hate books and schools and teachers and spend all their days with toys and games must sooner or later turn into donkeys.&quot;</p></div> </div>
