The field was full of vines heavy with grapes. The grapes were no other than gold coins which tinkled merrily as they swayed in the wind. They seemed to say, &quot;Let him who wants us take us!&quot;</p><p>Just as Pinocchio stretched out his hand to take a handful of them, he was awakened by three loud knocks at the door.
