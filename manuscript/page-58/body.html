Bad, very bad! In this world, even as children, we must accustom ourselves to eat of everything, for we never know what life may hold in store for us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You may be right,&quot; answered Pinocchio, &quot;but I will not eat the pears if they are not peeled. I don&apos;t like them.&quot;</p><p>And good old Geppetto took out a knife, peeled the three pears, and put the skins in a row on the table.</p></div> </div>
