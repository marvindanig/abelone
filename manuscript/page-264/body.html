<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;My dear boy,&quot; said the Fairy, &quot;people who speak as you do usually end their days either in a prison or in a hospital. A man, remember, whether rich or poor, should do something in this world. No one can find happiness without work. Woe betide the lazy fellow! Laziness is a serious illness and one must cure it immediately; yes, even from early childhood. If not, it will kill you in the end.&quot;</p></div> </div>
