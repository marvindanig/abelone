<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What a look of surprise shone on Mastro Cherry&apos;s face! His funny face became still funnier.</p><p>He turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee, little voice had come from and he saw no one! He looked under the bench&#x2014;no one! He peeped inside the closet&#x2014;no one! He searched among the shavings&#x2014;no one! He opened the door to look up and down the street&#x2014;and still no one!</p><p>&quot;Oh, I see!&quot; he then said, laughing and scratching his Wig. &quot;It can easily be seen that I only thought I heard the tiny voice say the words! Well, well&#x2014;to work once more.&quot;</p></div> </div>
