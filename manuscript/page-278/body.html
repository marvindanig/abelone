<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Hey, Pinocchio,&quot; cried the tallest of them all, &quot;that will do. We are tired of hearing you bragging about yourself, you little turkey cock! You may not be afraid of us, but remember we are not afraid of you, either! You are alone, you know, and we are seven.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like the seven sins,&quot; said Pinocchio, still laughing.</p><p>&quot;Did you hear that? He has insulted us all. He has called us sins.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pinocchio, apologize for that, or look out!&quot;</p></div> </div>
