<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As soon as he set foot on the beach, Pinocchio gave a leap and fell into the water. Alidoro tried to stop, but as he was running very fast, he couldn&apos;t, and he, too, landed far out in the sea. Strange though it may seem, the Dog could not swim. He beat the water with his paws to hold himself up, but the harder he tried, the deeper he sank. As he stuck his head out once more, the poor fellow&apos;s eyes were bulging and he barked out wildly, &quot;I drown! I drown!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Drown!&quot; answered Pinocchio from afar, happy at his escape.</p></div> </div>
