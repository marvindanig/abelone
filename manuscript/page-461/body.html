<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was the Fox and the Cat, but one could hardly recognize them, they looked so miserable. The Cat, after pretending to be blind for so many years had really lost the sight of both eyes. And the Fox, old, thin, and almost hairless, had even lost his tail. That sly thief had fallen into deepest poverty, and one day he had been forced to sell his beautiful tail for a bite to eat.</p><p>&quot;Oh, Pinocchio,&quot; he cried in a tearful voice. &quot;Give us some alms, we beg of you! We are old, tired, and sick.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sick!&quot; repeated the Cat.</p></div> </div>
