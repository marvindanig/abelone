But when he reached it, remembering his donkey ears, he felt ashamed to show them to the public and turned back. He took a large cotton bag from a shelf, put it on his head, and pulled it far down to his very nose.</p><p>Thus adorned, he went out.

In desperation, he returned home and knocked at the door.</p></div> </div>
