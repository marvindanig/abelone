Turning around, the fisher folk saw Pinocchio dive into the sea and heard him cry out:</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ll save him! I&apos;ll save my father!&quot;</p><p>The Marionette, being made of wood, floated easily along and swam like a fish in the rough water. Now and again he disappeared only to reappear once more.

At last he was completely lost to view.</p><p>&quot;Poor boy!&quot; cried the fisher folk on the shore, and again they mumbled a few prayers, as they returned home.</p></div> </div>
