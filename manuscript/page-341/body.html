<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;You are making a big mistake, Pinocchio. Believe me, if you don&apos;t come, you&apos;ll be sorry. Where can you find a place that will agree better with you and me? No schools, no teachers, no books! In that blessed place there is no such thing as study. Here, it is only on Saturdays that we have no school. In the Land of Toys, every day, except Sunday, is a Saturday. Vacation begins on the first of January and ends on the last day of December. That is the place for me! All countries should be like it! How happy we should all be!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But how does one spend the day in the Land of Toys?&quot;</p></div> </div>
