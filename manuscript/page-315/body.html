<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I was lying here on the sand more dead than alive, when an appetizing odor of fried fish came to me. That odor tickled my hunger and I followed it. Oh, if I had come a moment later!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t speak about it,&quot; wailed Pinocchio, still trembling with fright. &quot;Don&apos;t say a word. If you had come a moment later, I would be fried, eaten, and digested by this time. Brrrrrr! I shiver at the mere thought of it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
