I am so old, I could almost be your mother!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am very glad of that, for then I can call you mother instead of sister. For a long time I have wanted a mother, just like other boys. But how did you grow so quickly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s a secret!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tell it to me. I also want to grow a little. Look at me! I have never grown higher than a penny&apos;s worth of cheese.&quot;</p></div> </div>
