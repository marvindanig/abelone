<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;This is our plan: We&apos;ll come once in a while, as in the past, to pay a visit to this henhouse, and we&apos;ll take away eight chickens. Of these, seven are for us, and one for you, provided, of course, that you will make believe you are sleeping and will not bark for the Farmer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did Melampo really do that?&quot; asked Pinocchio.</p><p>&quot;Indeed he did, and because of that we were the best of friends. Sleep away peacefully, and remember that before we go we shall leave you a nice fat chicken all ready for your breakfast in the morning. Is that understood?&quot;</p></div> </div>
