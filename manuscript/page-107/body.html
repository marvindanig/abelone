<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I&apos;ll explain,&quot; said the Fox. &quot;You must know that, just outside the City of Simple Simons, there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders. In this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece. After covering up the hole with earth you water it well, sprinkle a bit of salt on it, and go to bed. During the night, the gold piece sprouts, grows, blossoms, and next morning you find a beautiful tree, that is loaded with gold pieces.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So that if I were to bury my five gold pieces,&quot; cried Pinocchio with growing wonder, &quot;next morning I should find&#x2014;how many?&quot;</p></div> </div>
