You did me a good turn, and, in this world, what is given is always returned. If the chance comes, I shall be there.&quot;</p><p>Pinocchio went on swimming close to shore. At last he thought he had reached a safe place. Glancing up and down the beach, he saw the opening of a cave out of which rose a spiral of smoke.</p><p>&quot;In that cave,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;there must be a fire. So much the better. I&apos;ll dry my clothes and warm myself, and then&#x2014;well&#x2014;&quot;</p></div> </div>
