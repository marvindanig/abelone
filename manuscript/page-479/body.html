She has been stricken with trouble and illness, and she hasn&apos;t a penny left with which to buy a bite of bread.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Oh, how sorry I am! My poor, dear little Fairy! If I had a million I should run to her with it! But I have only fifty pennies. Here they are. I was just going to buy some clothes. Here, take them, little Snail, and give them to my good Fairy.&quot;</p></div> </div>
