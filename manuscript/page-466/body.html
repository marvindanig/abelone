Throw a hammer at me now. I deserve it! But spare my poor old father.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am going to spare both the father and the son. I have only wanted to remind you of the trick you long ago played upon me, to teach you that in this world of ours we must be kind and courteous to others, if we want to find kindness and courtesy in our own days of trouble.&quot;</p></div> </div>
