<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know, Father, but believe me, the night has been a terrible one and I shall remember it as long as I live. The thunder was so noisy and the lightning so bright&#x2014;and I was hungry. And then the Talking Cricket said to me, &apos;You deserve it; you were bad;&apos; and I said to him, &apos;Careful, Cricket;&apos; and he said to me, &apos;You are a Marionette and you have a wooden head;&apos; and I threw the hammer at him and killed him. It was his own fault, for I didn&apos;t want to kill him. And I put the pan on the coals, but the Chick flew away and said, &apos;I&apos;ll see you again! Remember me to the family.&apos; And my hunger grew, and I went out, and the old man with a nightcap looked out of the window and threw water on me, and I came home and put my feet on the stove to dry them because I was still hungry, and I fell asleep and now my feet are gone but my hunger isn&apos;t! Oh!&#x2014;Oh!&#x2014;Oh!&quot; And poor Pinocchio began to scream and cry so loudly that he could be heard for miles around.</p></div> </div>
