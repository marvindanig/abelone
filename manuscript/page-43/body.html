Certain that he was dreaming, he turned the egg over and over in his hands, fondled it, kissed it, and talked to it:</p><p>&quot;And now, how shall I cook you? Shall I make an omelet? No, it is better to fry you in a pan! Or shall I drink you? No, the best way is to fry you in the pan. You will taste better.&quot;</p></div> </div>
