<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As knocking was of no use, Pinocchio, in despair, began to kick and bang against the door, as if he wanted to break it. At the noise, a window opened and a lovely maiden looked out. She had azure hair and a face white as wax. Her eyes were closed and her hands crossed on her breast. With a voice so weak that it hardly could be heard, she whispered:</p><p>&quot;No one lives in this house. Everyone is dead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Won&apos;t you, at least, open the door for me?&quot; cried Pinocchio in a beseeching voice.</p><p>&quot;I also am dead.&quot;</p></div> </div>
