<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;In school today, I&apos;ll learn to read, tomorrow to write, and the day after tomorrow I&apos;ll do arithmetic. Then, clever as I am, I can earn a lot of money. With the very first pennies I make, I&apos;ll buy Father a new cloth coat. Cloth, did I say? No, it shall be of gold and silver with diamond buttons. That poor man certainly deserves it; for, after all, isn&apos;t he in his shirt sleeves because he was good enough to buy a book for me? On this cold day, too! Fathers are indeed good to their children!&quot;</p></div> </div>
