Pinocchio is arrested.</p><p>Going like the wind, Pinocchio took but a very short time to reach the shore. He glanced all about him, but there was no sign of a Shark. The sea was as smooth as glass.</p><p>&quot;Hey there, boys! Where&apos;s that Shark?&quot; he asked, turning to his playmates.</p><p>&quot;He may have gone for his breakfast,&quot; said one of them, laughing.</p><p>&quot;Or, perhaps, he went to bed for a little nap,&quot; said another, laughing also.</p></div> </div>
