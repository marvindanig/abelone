<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Too bad! I&apos;ll explain myself better,&quot; said the Parrot. &quot;While you were away in the city the Fox and the Cat returned here in a great hurry. They took the four gold pieces which you have buried and ran away as fast as the wind. If you can catch them, you&apos;re a brave one!&quot;</p><p>Pinocchio&apos;s mouth opened wide. He would not believe the Parrot&apos;s words and began to dig away furiously at the earth. He dug and he dug till the hole was as big as himself, but no money was there. Every penny was gone.</p></div> </div>
