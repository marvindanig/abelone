The Marionette, being no exception to this rule, slept on peacefully for a few hours till well along toward midnight, when he was awakened by strange whisperings and stealthy sounds coming from the yard. He stuck his nose out of the doghouse and saw four slender, hairy animals. They were Weasels, small animals very fond of both eggs and chickens. One of them left her companions and, going to the door of the doghouse, said in a sweet voice:</p><p>&quot;Good evening, Melampo.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My name is not Melampo,&quot; answered Pinocchio.</p></div> </div>
