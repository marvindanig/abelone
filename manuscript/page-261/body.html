<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I know it, and for that I have forgiven you. The depth of your sorrow made me see that you have a kind heart. There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours, though they may often be very mischievous. This is the reason why I have come so far to look for you. From now on, I&apos;ll be your own little mother.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh! How lovely!&quot; cried Pinocchio, jumping with joy.</p><p>&quot;You will obey me always and do as I wish?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gladly, very gladly, more than gladly!&quot;</p></div> </div>
