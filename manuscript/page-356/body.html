Will you come with us, or do you stay here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I stay here,&quot; answered Pinocchio. &quot;I want to return home, as I prefer to study and to succeed in life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;May that bring you luck!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pinocchio!&quot; Lamp-Wick called out. &quot;Listen to me. Come with us and we&apos;ll always be happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot;</p></div> </div>
