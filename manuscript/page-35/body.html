<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Woe to boys who refuse to obey their parents and run away from home! They will never be happy in this world, and when they are older they will be very sorry for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sing on, Cricket mine, as you please. What I know is, that tomorrow, at dawn, I leave this place forever. If I stay here the same thing will happen to me which happens to all other boys and girls. They are sent to school, and whether they want to or not, they must study. As for me, let me tell you, I hate to study! It&apos;s much more fun, I think, to chase after butterflies, climb trees, and steal birds&apos; nests.&quot;</p></div> </div>
