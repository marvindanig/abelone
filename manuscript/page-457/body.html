<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Tunny, you arrived at the right moment! I implore you, for the love you bear your children, the little Tunnies, to help us, or we are lost!&quot;</p><p>&quot;With great pleasure indeed. Hang onto my tail, both of you, and let me lead you. In a twinkling you will be safe on land.&quot;</p><p>Geppetto and Pinocchio, as you can easily imagine, did not refuse the invitation; indeed, instead of hanging onto the tail, they thought it better to climb on the Tunny&apos;s back.</p><p>&quot;Are we too heavy?&quot; asked Pinocchio.</p></div> </div>
