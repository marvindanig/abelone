His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry.</p><p>As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy. Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself:</p><p>&quot;This has come in the nick of time. I shall use it to make the leg of a table.&quot;</p></div> </div>
